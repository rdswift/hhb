# HHB - Interactive HTML Help Builder
## Command Line Interface (CLI)

**This project provides a free, open source, program to help manage the development of HTML Help (CHM) files.  There are other programs out there that build the HTML Help files, but our experience is that they are either not free and open source, are limited in the format of the resulting help files, or are restrictive in terms of licensing.  Thus the reason for developing this project.**

**All help system project files (including configuration options) are stored as plain text (or XML) files. This allows collaboration during help system development, using tools such as** ***[git](https://git-scm.com/ "https://git-scm.com/")*** **to manage all changes to the help project source code repository.**

**The system also supports the use of templates for HTML formatting.**

**The command line interface provides the ability to compile a help project, as well as compile (or decompile) an HHB Template (.hhbt) file.**

**The program is written in C#, and has been developed and compiled using** ***[MS Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/ "https://www.visualstudio.com/").***

**The project is currently in the planning stage and we're looking for people who would like to contribute to the development.  If you're interested, please join us in the** ***[Developers](https://sourceforge.net/p/oshhb/discussion/developers/thread/11736c7e/ "https://sourceforge.net/p/oshhb/discussion/developers/thread/11736c7e/")*** **forum.**
