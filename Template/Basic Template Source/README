This is the basic template provided with the HTML Help Builder package.  
The following sections provide some thoughts as to how this template can be 
used for your help system projects.

1. Header

The template contains a header section which displays the number and title 
of the current screen as well as a link to the default (top) screen. The 
"show header" option for the screen determines whether or not the header is 
displayed. To avoid display of the screen index numbers in the header 
section, attach a CSS file to the screen with the content: 

  .HEADERNUMBER { display: none; }

The header is wrapped between <div class="HEADER"> ... </div> tags.  
Changes to the format of the header can be made by attaching a CSS file to 
the screen with the desired changes, such as:

  .HEADER { border: 5px solid red; }


2. Title

The template contains a title section which displays the number and title 
of the current screen. The "show title" option for the screen determines 
whether or not the title section is displayed. To avoid display of the 
screen index numbers in the title section, attach a CSS file to the screen 
with the content: 

  .TITLENUMBER { display: none; }

The title is wrapped between <div class="TITLE"> ... </div> tags.  Changes 
to the format of the title can be made by attaching a CSS file to the 
screen with the desired changes, such as:

  .TITLE { text-decoration: underline; }


3. References

The template contains a references section which will display the reference 
links as a list.  Each item in the list of references if bounded by 
<li class="REFERENCE"> ... </li> tags.  This will allow you to change the 
formatting of the reference items by including a CSS file with the desired 
changes, such as:

  .REFERENCE { font-style: italic; }

Note that this section will only be displayed if references have been 
identified for the screen.  
  

4. Body

The body section of the template will be inserted from the body text 
assigned to the screen.  This can contain any of the replaceable parameters 
such as:

  * {TITLE} will be replaced by the help screen title.
  
  * {PREVLINK} will be replaced by a link to the previous screen in 
    the Table of Contents, or "" if no previous page exists.
  
  * {NEXTLINK} will be replaced by a link to the next screen in the 
    Table of Contents, or "" if no following page exists.
  
  * {HOMELINK} will be replaced by a link to the user-specified default 
    screen, or the first screen in the Table of Contents if not 
    specified.
  
  * {PREVTEXT} will be replaced by the title of the previous screen in 
    the Table of Contents, or "" if no previous page exists.
  
  * {NEXTTEXT} will be replaced by the title of the next screen in the 
    Table of Contents, or "" if no following page exists.
  
  * {HOMETEXT} will be replaced by the title of the user-specified 
    default screen, or the first screen in the Table of Contents if not 
    specified.
  
  * {NUMBER} will be replaced with the number of the entry in the Table 
    of Contents (e.g. the third subtopic of the second topic would be 
    number 2.3).  For pop-up screens this will be "".
  
  * {YEAR} will be replaced with the four digit year when the help 
    project was compiled.
  
  * {DATE} will be replaced with the date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" 
    when the help project was compiled.

Note that these can appear multiple times if required anywhere within the 
HTML document.

The body section is wrapped between <div class="SCREENBODY"> ... </div> 
tags.  Changes to the format of the body can be made by attaching a CSS 
file to the screen with the desired changes, such as:

  .SCREENBODY { font-family: "Times New Roman", Georgia, Serif; }


5. Footer

The template contains a footer section which displays the number and title 
of the previous and next screens in the Table of Contents as links to these 
screens. The "show footer" option for the screen determines whether or not 
the footer is displayed. To avoid display of the screen index numbers in 
the footer section, attach a CSS file to the screen with the content: 

  .FOOTERNUMBER { display: none; }

The footer is wrapped between <div class="FOOTER"> ... </div> tags.  
Changes to the format of the footer can be made by attaching a CSS file to 
the screen with the desired changes, such as:

  .FOOTER { border: 5px solid red; }
